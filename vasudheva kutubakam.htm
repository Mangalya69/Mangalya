<h1 style="color:mediumseagreen;"> BASIC IDEA OF ONE EARTH, ONE FAMILY, ONE FUTURE </h1>
<br>
<br>
<p style="font-size:200%;">India has got the presidency of G20 for fy 2023-2024. Every host nation gets a chance to select a theme of their upcoming summits. India being the host nation <has selected the theme of<b>One Earth, One Family, One Future</b>. The idea of this theme from an ancient sanskrit saying "Vasudheva Kutumbakam". It signals the need for unity of purpose and unity of action. I hope that your meeting today will reflect this spirit of coming together for achieving common and concrete objectives.</p>

<h1 style="color:crimson;"> ONE EARTH MEANS PROTECTING OUR PLANET , OUR HOME. </h1>
</marquee>
<br>
<br>
<p style="font-size:200%;">Our planet ,Earth has been witnessing severe climate changes that have been affecting our planet negatively. We need to fight this change collectively because individual efforts will not put a huge impact. We need to become a single family as earthlings and fight this change.</p>
<br>
<p style="font-size:200%;"> Our collective aim here would be to go along with the principles of the Paris Agreement, which will help us redirect thousands of billions of dollars towards green projects including carbon neutralisation, oxygen exponentiation</p>
<br>
<p style="font-size:200%"> IMF worries that thiis gradual climate changes might lead to economy downfall (depreciation). that is why many countries are being granted access towards Resilience and Sustainability Trust. This demonstrates how we are helping vunerable countries by setting up the right policies. </p>

<h1 style="color:mediumturquoise;"> ONE FAMILY MEANS SOLIDARITY AND PROTECTING THE VULNERABLE. </h1>
</marquee>
<br>
<p style="font-size:200%">The whole concept of One earth, One Family, One Future came from "vasudheva kutambakam" which literaly means that "the whole earth is one singular family, so one family is an important element of this theme.</p>
<br>
<p style="font-size:200%"> People in many countries around the world are not even able to afford to live reputably because of the high cost of living in present day. Millions couldn't afford fuel for heating or cooking. 349 million people of 79 countries are suffering from food insecurity due to the rising prices of food.</p>
<br>
<p style="font-size:200%"> All the above things mentioned are just the cause of one thing that is "inflation". The current global inflation rate is near to all time high records.Due to this second and third world countries are struggling to keep their economies stable and due to that they take loans which can lead to debt. Most of these debt taking countries have limited repayment resources and high debt.</p>
<br>
<p style="font-size:200%">Everything given above gives a message that it is high time that we know how important helping these countries this.</p>

<br>
<br>
<p style="font-size:200%">One future refers to getting unified and working on the future of our earth together. which means the countries shall go using and reffering to eeach other's idea.</p>
<br>
<p style="font-size:200%"> innovations can come from anywhere, be it a small hut or highrise, be it a dumb person or einstein, hence giving every country a chance to present their ideas will help us weave the future of our dreams.</p>

<h1 style="color:mediumblue;"> This spirit of “one” should guide us as we move forward. </h1>
</marquee>
<br><br>
<p style="font-size:200%">To achieve the goals of ‘One Earth, One Family, One Future’, we need to find common ground even as geopolitical tensions are rising. And we need to steer clear of zero-sum policies that would only leave the world poorer and less secure.</p>
<br>
<p style="font-size:200%">As Rabindranath Tagore once said: “ You can’t cross the sea merely by standing and staring at the water .”</p>
